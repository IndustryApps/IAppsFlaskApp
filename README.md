# Demo Flask App

## Install dependency libraries

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run app

### Provide app properties

``APPCODE`` and ``HOSTNAME`` should be provided in the sample source code.

**APPCODE** can be found in the App Publish page of the vendor portal.

**HOSTNAME** is your app's domain name.

To run the app.

```shell
flask run
```

or simply

```shell
python app.py
```

The app will be running on port ``5000``

### Testing in localhost
For testing in localhost, you can use some HTTP traffic tunneling application like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and configure the dynamic domain name generated by ngrok in your app.
